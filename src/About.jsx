          Hello world, I'm Sam
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’m a self-taught, hobbyist software developer who codes simply for the joy of it.
          Programming has always been a space where I get to create without limits.
          I'm passionate about creating digital solutions that combine creativity and functionality.
          Through this fusion, I find fulfillment and purpose in my work.
        </p>
         <p>
          I was born and raised in Southern California. I currently live in Utrecht with my husband and our sweet cat, Ares.
          In my free time, you can find me practicing yoga, solving puzzles, or watching movies.
          When the weather permits, I love to go on picnics and hike. I am in constant pursuit of new experiences, embracing the richness that life has to offer.
