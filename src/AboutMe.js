      <p>I was born and raised in Southern California. I currently live in Denver with my husband, Justin, and our cute
        cat, Ares.</p>
      <p>In my free time you can find me practing yoga, solving puzzles, or watching movies. When the weather permits, I
        love to go on picnics and hike.</p>
